# InnoNote Todo Application
I have created a functioning and responsive todo app utiliting Front-End Mentor, Figma, and Github. I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## The challenge
    - Build out a todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
    - Your users should be able to:
        - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
        - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
        - Add new todos to the list
        - Mark todos as complete
        - Delete todos from the list
        - Filter by all/active/complete todos
        - Clear all completed todos
        - Toggle light and dark mode

## Building your project
Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. *crucial* to help think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure content with HTML. Writing HTML first can help focus attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once happy with the area you're working on.
